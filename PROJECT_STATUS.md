## What Is Implemented

### Infrastructure

- Repository layout (`frontend/`, `backend/`, root config)
- Docker Compose: PostgreSQL 16, FastAPI backend, Next.js frontend (all with health checks)
- Environment config (`.env.example`, `.env.production.example`, `APP_ENV`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, `DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `COOKIE_SECURE`, `COOKIE_SAMESITE`, `COOKIE_HTTPONLY`, `TEST_DATABASE_URL`)
- HTTPS-ready configuration: production URLs require `https://`; local development uses HTTP
- CORS credentialed requests enabled (`allow_credentials=True`) for future cookie-based auth
- Cookie security flags environment-driven (`backend/app/core/cookies.py`)
- Production Dockerfiles with health checks and startup validation
- Production startup skips automatic schema changes (`APP_ENV=production`)
- Startup validation for required config and database connectivity
- Structured logging on backend startup and shutdown
- GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on push/PR to `main`
- GitHub Actions CD (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) on push to `main` after CI passes
- AWS production deployment (ECS Fargate, ALB, RDS PostgreSQL, ECR, ACM, Route 53)
- Production HTTPS: https://app.jakesfinancetracker.com / https://api.jakesfinancetracker.com

### Frontend

- Next.js 15 (App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4)
- shadcn/ui, React Hook Form + Zod, Lucide React, Recharts
- Off-white / soft-green theme; Geist Sans via `next/font`
- Full-height sidebar app shell at `lg` (1024px+); hamburger menu with slide-out drawer below `lg`
- Authenticated routes behind `AuthGuard`
- Responsive page layouts with scaled spacing (`space-y-5` mobile → `lg:space-y-8` desktop)
- Login and registration pages; JWT stored in `localStorage` (httpOnly cookie migration planned)
- API client sends `credentials: "include"` on all requests
- Loading skeletons and error states with retry
- Health endpoint: `GET /health` (public, no auth; used by ALB target group)
- Custom 404 page (`app/not-found.tsx`) matching app design system
- Shared `DialogShell` for scrollable edit dialogs on small screens
- `useMediaQuery` hook for responsive chart sizing

#### Pages

| Route | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `/login` | Functional | Email/password form, stores JWT, redirects to dashboard; responsive layout |
| `/register` | Functional | Email/password registration (min 8 chars), redirects to login; responsive layout |
| `/dashboard` | Functional | All-time balance; current-month income/expenses; top 5 budgets by usage; 5 recent transactions; charts; responsive grids and charts |
| `/transactions` | Functional | Create/edit/delete with user-selected date; free-text category; search, type/category filters, pagination; card layout below `lg`, table at `lg+` |
| `/budgets` | Functional | Add/edit/delete budgets, progress bars, loading/error states; responsive card grid |
| `/health` | Functional | Public health check; returns `{"status":"ok"}` for ALB |
| `/*` (unknown routes) | Functional | Custom 404 page via `app/not-found.tsx`; responsive centered layout |

### Backend

- FastAPI with CORS, SQLAlchemy 2.x, Pydantic schemas
- Health endpoint: `GET /health`
- Password hashing (passlib + bcrypt), JWT auth (`python-jose`)
- All data routes protected and scoped to authenticated user
- Category normalization (trim + title case); case-insensitive budget matching
- Lightweight startup migrations for legacy databases
- pytest suite with isolated `finance_app_test` database

#### Models

| Model | Fields |
|-------|--------|
| `User` | `id`, `email` (unique), `hashed_password`, `created_at` |
| `Transaction` | `id`, `user_id` (FK CASCADE), `description`, `amount`, `type`, `category`, `transaction_date`, `created_at` |
| `Budget` | `id`, `user_id` (FK CASCADE), `category`, `limit_amount`, `created_at`, `updated_at` |

#### API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| GET | `/health` | Health check |
| POST | `/auth/register` | Creates user |
| POST | `/auth/login` | Returns JWT |

### Post-M8 polish (included above)

- Net Savings card removed; Balance / Income / Expenses only
- Full-height sidebar; Geist Sans typography
- Free-text category input (no autocomplete); sort controls removed from UI
- User-selectable `transaction_date` on create/edit
- Dashboard date selector removed; balance is all-time, income/expense are current month
- Dashboard widgets limited to 5 recent transactions and 5 highest-usage budgets
- Transaction edit dialog Select controlled-state fix

### UX polish (M14)

- Custom 404 page (`app/not-found.tsx`) with centered layout, app branding, and navigation to dashboard/login
- Frontend `GET /health` endpoint added for ALB target group health checks
- ALB target group health checks configured to use `/health` on frontend and backend

### Mobile responsiveness (M16)

Responsive layout foundation across all frontend pages. Desktop appearance at `lg` (1024px+) is preserved; phones and tablets receive adapted layouts.

| Area | Implementation |
|------|----------------|
| Mobile navigation | Hamburger menu and slide-out drawer below `lg`; permanent sidebar unchanged at `lg+` |
| Responsive layouts | `min-w-0` and `overflow-x-hidden` containment; scaled page padding and section spacing |
| Responsive forms | Full-width inputs on small screens; stacked submit/cancel buttons; `h-10` touch targets on mobile |
| Responsive dashboard | Stacked summary cards on mobile; responsive chart heights and compact axis/legend sizing |
| Responsive transactions | Wrapping filter controls; card-based transaction list below `lg`; table view at `lg+` |
| Responsive budgets | Single-column card grid on mobile; responsive progress bars and edit dialogs |
| Tablet support | Intermediate breakpoints (`sm`, `md`) for grids, spacing, and two-column form layouts |
| Touch usability | Larger icon buttons in navigation and action rows; full-width pagination buttons on mobile |

**Mobile navigation**
- `AppShell` shows a mobile header with hamburger button below `lg`
- Slide-out drawer reuses `SidebarNavContent` with close button and route-change auto-close
- Desktop sidebar (`w-64`, full viewport height) unchanged at `lg+`

**Responsive layouts**
- Page content padding: `px-4 py-6` mobile → `sm:px-6 sm:py-8` → `lg:px-8 lg:py-8` desktop
- Section spacing: `space-y-5` mobile → `sm:space-y-6` → `lg:space-y-8` desktop
- Grid children use `[&>*]:min-w-0` to prevent card overflow

**Responsive forms**
- Create/edit forms on transactions and budgets: single-column on mobile, two-column at `sm+`
- Select triggers default to `w-full min-w-0`
- Edit dialogs use `DialogShell` with `max-h-[calc(100dvh-2rem)]` and vertical scroll

**Responsive dashboard**
- Summary cards stack vertically on mobile; `sm:grid-cols-2`, `lg:grid-cols-3` on larger screens
- Charts use `ResponsiveContainer` with scaled heights and compact tick/legend sizing below `lg`
- Budget progress and recent transaction widgets wrap content and truncate long text

**Responsive transactions**
- Filter row stacks on mobile; search spans full width
- Transaction list renders stacked cards below `lg`; existing table preserved at `lg+`
- Pagination buttons full-width on mobile in a two-column grid

**Responsive budgets**
- Budget cards in responsive grid (`grid-cols-1` → `sm:grid-cols-2` → `lg:grid-cols-3`)
- Progress bars use `overflow-hidden` tracks; category and amount rows wrap on narrow screens
- Create and edit budget dialogs match transaction dialog responsive patterns

**Authentication and 404**
- Login and register pages: centered layout, `max-w-md`, responsive typography and touch-friendly inputs/buttons
- 404 page: scaled heading (`text-6xl` → `lg:text-8xl`), stacked full-width action buttons on mobile

**QA pass**
- Full responsive review across all pages at 320–1440px widths
- Horizontal scrolling, clipped dialogs/charts, and inconsistent breakpoints addressed
- Frontend build verified after changes

### HTTPS deployment (M15)

# Activate (choose one):
# PowerShell:  .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# CMD:         .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pytest
```

### AWS deployment / production launch (M12)

Application is live in AWS production. Both ECS services are running and verified.

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Frontend on AWS ECS Fargate behind Application Load Balancer | Running |
| Backend on AWS ECS Fargate behind Application Load Balancer | Running |
| PostgreSQL on AWS RDS | Running |
| Docker images in Amazon ECR | Active |
| ECS services running | Verified |
| Frontend and backend communicating | Verified |
| Database persistence | Verified |
| Backend `APP_ENV` set to `production` | Configured |
| Production environment variables via ECS | Configured |
| End-to-end production verification | Verified |

Production configuration:

- Backend runs with `APP_ENV=production` (no automatic schema changes on startup)
- Environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `SECRET_KEY`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, etc.) set through ECS task definitions
- Frontend image built with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://api.jakesfinancetracker.com`
- Health checks: backend and frontend `GET /health` (ALB target groups)

See [README.md](./README.md#aws-deployment) for deployment architecture and troubleshooting.

### Continuous integration and deployment (M11 + M13)

Full CI/CD pipeline is operational. Pushing to `main` triggers validation and production deployment.

**CI** — [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)

Runs on every push and pull request to `main`. Three parallel jobs:

| Job | Validates |
|-----|-----------|
| Backend Tests | pytest against PostgreSQL service (Python 3.12) |
| Frontend Build | `npm ci`, ESLint, production `npm run build` (Node 20) |
| Docker Validation | Backend and frontend image builds; `docker compose config` |

**CD** — [`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`](.github/workflows/deploy.yml)

Runs automatically after CI succeeds on `main` push, or manually via **Actions → Deploy → Run workflow**.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| Trigger | CI success on `main` push, or manual `workflow_dispatch` |
| Build | Backend and frontend Docker images tagged with commit SHA |
| Push | Images published to Amazon ECR |
| Deploy | ECS task definitions updated; services rolled out |
| Verify | Backend `/health` and frontend availability checked |

Current production state:

- Push to `main` → CI passes → CD deploys to ECS
- HTTPS health checks verified on both frontend and backend
- Live at https://app.jakesfinancetracker.com

See [README.md](./README.md#continuous-integration) and [README.md](./README.md#continuous-deployment) for details.

## What Is NOT Implemented

- Transaction detail view (single-transaction page)
- Category autocomplete (intentionally removed; free-text only)
- Alembic migrations (production schema changes are manual when `APP_ENV=production`)
- Next.js middleware for server-side route protection
- Token refresh / rotation; httpOnly cookie storage
- Dedicated category database table
- Advanced dashboard analytics (goals, forecasts, etc.)
- Dashboard date range selector UI (removed; backend params remain)

## How to Run

### Full stack (Docker)

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # first time only
docker compose up -d --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### Local frontend development

```bash
# Terminal 1 — database + backend
docker compose up -d postgres backend

# Terminal 2 — frontend
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Manual test checklist

1. Register at `/register`, sign in at `/login`
2. Create/edit/delete transactions with a custom date and free-text category
3. Use search, type/category filters, and pagination on `/transactions`
4. Create budgets on `/budgets`; verify progress updates
5. Open `/dashboard` — summary cards, top 5 budgets, 5 recent transactions, charts
6. Confirm sidebar spans full viewport height at `lg+`; hamburger navigation works below `lg`
7. Sign in as a second user — confirm data isolation
8. Resize browser to 320px, 768px, and 1440px — confirm no horizontal scrolling on dashboard, transactions, budgets, login, and 404

---

## Suggested Next Steps

1. Auth hardening — migrate JWT to httpOnly Secure cookies, token refresh, Next.js middleware
2. Alembic migrations — replace manual production schema provisioning
3. CD hardening — GitHub OIDC instead of long-lived AWS access keys; deployment approval gates
